                    Luna’s mental health.</h5>

            </div>
            <div class="article-text">
                <p>Luna Marko was born in Australia in a stable and secure family. They had no real money issues growing
                    up - both her
                    parents are artists and educators; however, they have been moving from house to house as
                    renters.<br><br>
                    Luna’s story really starts with her gender, she is transgender.
                    “I’m demi female, which means I’m a girl who only has loose connections to gender. Like you know how
                    maybe you know
                    internally that you’re a girl? In my case, I don’t feel internally that I am of any gender, but I
                    feel some vague
                    connection with the term ‘girl’.”<br><br>

                    This part of her identity may seem small and insignificant; however, it has had a massive impact on
                    her experiences
                    growing up in Australia.<br>

                    Most of Luna’s extended family are white Christians who are more politically right-wing. Many of
                    them,” don’t quite
                    approve of my gender, in fact, I’ve had an uncle say in my vicinity that ‘trans people don’t exist'
                    and that being trans
                    is ‘a mental illness’.”<br><br>

                    This negativity towards the ‘insignificant' part of her identity has come from almost everywhere in
                    her life, and while
                    her parents are supportive, she states that she is still having massive trouble coping with a lot of
                    the stress her
                    identity puts her under.<br><br>

                    However, this isn’t the only part of her teenage life that she is having difficulty in. ‘I’m
                    terrified when it comes to
                    other normal teenage things as well, like dating and stuff. I’m worried that people will find me
                    weird and
                    unattractive.’<br>

                    She continued to say, ‘This attitude has been instilled in me since I was very young by the news and
                    media I consumed,
                    as well as by people in my life, whether intentional or not. And that is not something any young
                    people should have to
                    deal with.’<br><br>

                    Being trans in Australia has also affected Luna’s confidence in other areas of life. Whilst at
                    school, she wears the
                    winter skirt but changes out of it every day because her parents are scared what’ll happen on public
                    transport as they
                    know people to whom it has happened recently in suburban Melbourne.<br>

            <img src="img/gender2.jpg" width="100%" />
            <div class="article-text" style="padding-top: 20px;">
                <p>“This is just me trying to grow up like a normal kid in Australia and I can’t even do that because
                    even something as
                    insignificant as my gender is a political statement,” she confessed, “All this culminates in an
                    extremely poor mental
                    state that I’m in almost constantly.”<br><br>

                    Despite all this, Luna is grateful that she grew up in Melbourne because even though gender diverse
                    kids do not get the
                    healthcare and support, they need, our communities have incredible mental health support networks,
                    all of which have
                    grown since the lockdown.<br>

                    “If I’m ever on the edge, I always know multiple people I can go to talk about it with,” said Luna.
